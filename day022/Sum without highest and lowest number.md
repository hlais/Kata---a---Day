* <b>Solved:</b>  Wenesday , January 31<sup>st</sup>, 2018

<b>Description:</b>

Sum all the numbers of the array (in F# and Haskell you get a list) except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
(The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)

Example:

{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
