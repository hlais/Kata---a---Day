Day #52: 

Difficulty: 6 kyu

Solved: Friday, March 2nd, 2018

Description:

Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example:

 persistence(39) == 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                      // and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(999) == 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                       // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

 persistence(4) == 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number
