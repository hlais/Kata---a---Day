<b>Description:</b>


You are given a string s. Every letter in s appears once.

Consider all strings formed by rearranging the letters in s. After ordering these strings in dictionary order, return the middle term. (If the sequence has a even length n, define its middle term to be the (n/2)th term.)

Example
For s = "abc", the result should be "bac".

The permutations in order are:
"abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"
So, The middle term is "bac".
Input/Output

unique letters (2 <= length <= 26)

[output] a string

middle permutation.
