A consonant is any letter of the alphabet except a, e, i ,o, u. The consonant substrings in the word "zodiacs" are z, d, cs. Assuming a = 1, b = 2 ... z = 26, the values of these substrings are 26 ,4, 22 because z = 26,d = 4,cs=3+19=22. The maximum value of these substrings is 26. Therefore, solve("zodiacs") = 26.

Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings.

Good luck!
