Create a function named divisors/Divisors that takes an integer and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself). If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' (null in C#) (use Either String a in Haskell and Result<Vec<u32>, String> in Rust).

Example:
Kata.Divisors(12) => new int[] {2, 3, 4, 6};
Kata.Divisors(25) => new int[] {5};
Kata.Divisors(13) => null;
You can assume that you will only get positive integers as inputs.
