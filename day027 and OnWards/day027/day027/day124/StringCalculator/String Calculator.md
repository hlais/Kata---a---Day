You start work at a new company that receives data monthly in a feed. The feed is fairly old and all of the data comes through as a string.

You are required to create a function that sums the list of comma seperated numbers that arrive in a string and return the result as an int:

AddStrings("12, 5, 3");  //should return: 20
The string passed into your function will only contain numbers in string format and can contain any number of comma seperated integers.
