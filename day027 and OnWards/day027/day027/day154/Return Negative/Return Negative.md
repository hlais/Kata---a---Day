Day #154: 

* <b>Difficulty:</b> 8 kyu
* <b>Solution Class:</b> [Return Negative](ReturnNegative.cs)
* <b>Solved:</b> Tuesday, July 17<sup>th</sup>, 2018

Details:

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

Kata.MakeNegative(1); // return -1
Kata.MakeNegative(-5); // return -5
Kata.MakeNegative(0); // return 0
Notes:

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
